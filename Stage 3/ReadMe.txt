Hello! Welcome to Mililani and Autumn's Program!

To compile the file, you can use your average IDE in the Command Prompt. First load the command prompt and change your directory to where the Java file is located. Then when you are in the proper directory, input javac Amenities.java Employee.java Guest.java Hotel.java MainTester.java Payment.java Payroll.java Reservation.java Room.java" as my file is titld.. From there it should reload to another line in which you can then input "java MainTester". This will load the program! 

Thank you for using our program!
